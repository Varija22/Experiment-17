Program 1 – Create a Single Node

Aim:
To create a single node of a linked list and display its value.

Software Used:
VS Code

Theory:

* A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by pointers.
* Each node has data and a **pointer to the next node.
* This program demonstrates the creation of a single node with a NULL pointer.

Algorithm:

1. Start.
2. Allocate memory for a node.
3. Store data in the node.
4. Set the pointer to NULL.
5. Display the node’s data.
6. Stop.

Conclusion:

* Successfully created a single node.
* Node stores data and points to NULL.
* Demonstrates the basic structure of a linked list node.

Program 2 – Add Multiple Nodes at the End

Aim:
To add multiple nodes at the end of a linked list and display the list.

Software Used:
VS Code 

Theory:

* Adding nodes at the end of a linked list involves creating a new node and linking it after the last node.
* This operation demonstrates how a linked list can dynamically grow.

Algorithm:

1. Start.
2. Input data for a new node.
3. Allocate memory and create a node.
4. If the list is empty, make this node the head.
5. Otherwise, traverse to the last node.
6. Link the new node to the last node.
7. Repeat for multiple nodes.
8. Display the linked list.
9. Stop.

Conclusion:

* Successfully added multiple nodes at the end of the linked list.
* Linked list grows dynamically without fixed size limitations.
* Demonstrates the traversal and insertion operation of linked lists.

Program 3 – Add Multiple Nodes at the Start

Aim:
To add multiple nodes at the start of a linked list and display the list.

Software Used:
VS Code

Theory:

* Adding nodes at the start involves linking the new node to the current head and updating the head pointer.
* This is useful when new data needs to be prioritized in the list.

Algorithm:

1. Start.
2. Input data for a new node.
3. Allocate memory and create the node.
4. Link the new node to the current head.
5. Update the head pointer to the new node.
6. Repeat for multiple nodes.
7. Display the linked list.
8. Stop.

Conclusion:

* Successfully added multiple nodes at the start of the linked list.
* Demonstrates dynamic insertion at the beginning of the list.
* Head pointer correctly updated, maintaining list integrity.
